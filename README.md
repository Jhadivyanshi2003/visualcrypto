The first file contains the code to break an image of the form .png to 2 cryptographical images.
This takes an input_image from the system that is of the form binary and break it into 2 halves.
The next file is to merge the 2 cryptographical image into single one to obtaine the orignal image.
This show the implementation of visual cryptography.
Thank you.
